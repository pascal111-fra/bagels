BAGELS!!! This is a game whose original version seems to be written by "D. Resek and D. Rowe" of the Lawrence hall of science, Berkeley, California. And the used version is the offered one by "CREATIVE COMPUTING MORRISTOWN, NEW JERSY".

Now, the current version between your hand are the visual programmed one, We converted it from the command-line style of traditional BASIC programming language to the visual programming style.

The idea of the game is that the computer will generate a number consisting of 3 digits and there is no two digits the same, each digit is unique, and you have 20 chances to guess the number, through your trying the computer will give you some aids, three words showing some solutions in your tries:

PICO: One digit is correct but in a wrong place.
 
FERMI: One digit is correct and in the correct place.
 
BAGELS: There is no correct digit in your try.

By the way, I didn't test all aspects of the game, and I hope if you find any inappropriate behaviour in the game to comment to me.

The game tested under Linux Mint and written by Lazarus Free Pascal.
